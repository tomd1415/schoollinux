            <h2>Overview of Phase 3</h2>
            <p>
                At this point, you have set up and configured the 20 classroom machines to authenticate against Active Directory, 
                mount user home directories from the central file server, and provide OneDrive access through Rclone. 
                In Phase 3, you will:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Introduce a group of pupils or test accounts to the new environment.</li>
                <li>Monitor their experience as they log in, access files, and use the system under normal classroom conditions.</li>
                <li>Collect feedback on usability, performance, and reliability.</li>
                <li>Identify and fix any minor issues discovered through real-world testing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By the end of Phase 3, you should have a clear understanding of how the system performs under actual use 
                and what, if any, adjustments are required before moving on to the evaluation phase.

        <!-- Step 1: User Logins and Experience -->
        <section class="step-box">
            <h3>Step 1: User Logins and Experience</h3>
            <p>
                Begin by having a small group of pupils (or a few test accounts) log into multiple machines. 
                Observe their interactions and note any issues. The goal is to confirm that domain authentication works smoothly and consistently.

                    <input type="checkbox" class="step-checkbox">
                    Instruct test users to log in using their AD credentials on various machines in the test environment.

                    <input type="checkbox" class="step-checkbox">
                    Confirm that login times are reasonable and users are not experiencing slow authentication.

                    <input type="checkbox" class="step-checkbox">
                    Observe if home directories mount correctly for each user and that their initial files (if any) are accessible.

        <section class="step-box">
            <h3>Step 2: Home Directories and OneDrive Access</h3>
            <p>
                Verify that user home directories and OneDrive integration are functioning as intended. Users should be able to 
                access their files from any machine, and their OneDrive files should be available on demand without significant delay.

                    <input type="checkbox" class="step-checkbox">
                    Ask users to open their home directories on multiple machines, ensuring the same files are visible each time.

                    <input type="checkbox" class="step-checkbox">
                    Have users open OneDrive from their home directory mount point and verify that files list and load correctly.

                    <input type="checkbox" class="step-checkbox">
                    Test file creation, editing, and saving back to OneDrive. Confirm that changes persist and sync as expected.

            <h3>Step 3: Performance and Reliability Checks</h3>
            <p>
                Assess how the system performs under typical classroom usage. Multiple users logging in simultaneously, 
                accessing various files, and using their home directories should not degrade performance significantly.

                    Monitor login times as several users log in at once. Are logins still quick and stable?

                    <input type="checkbox" class="step-checkbox">
                    Check network file transfers: have users open, edit, and save multiple small files and a few large files.

            <h3>Step 4: Feedback and Issue Collection</h3>
            <p>
                Gather qualitative and quantitative feedback from users. If pupils find certain operations confusing, 
                or if staff notice performance issues, record these observations for future adjustments.

                Use the collected feedback to make minor adjustments to configurations. 
                Update Ansible playbooks, tweak Samba or Winbind settings, or adjust Rclone mounts as needed.
