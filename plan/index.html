            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This pilot project aims to transition a classroom of 20 machines to Debian Linux, 
                integrated with Microsoft Active Directory (AD) and using open-source tools for file access. 
                Each machine will authenticate against AD, mount centrally hosted home directories, and 
                provide access to cloud storage (OneDrive) via open-source solutions. The environment will 
                be managed and configured through automation (e.g. Ansible) for consistency.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following phases outline the entire process from initial setup to evaluation. 
                Each phase has its own dedicated page with detailed instructions, checkboxes, and a 
                comment section. Use the links in the navigation bar to access each phaseâ€™s page.

            <h2>Phases of the Pilot</h2>
            <p>
                Each phase builds on the previous one, ensuring a structured approach to deploying, testing, 
                and evaluating the new environment.

                <h3>Phase 1: Preparation</h3>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Set the foundation for the pilot by isolating the test environment, preparing servers, and establishing automation frameworks.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Steps Include:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Configure a dedicated subnet (192.168.8.0/24) and VLAN for the 20 pilot machines.</li>
                    <li>Set up a central file server using Samba/Winbind integrated with AD.</li>
                    <li>Use a PXE server (192.168.8.3) to install Debian on all machines from the same image.</li>
                    <li>Install and configure Ansible on a control machine to manage all 20 Debian systems.</li>
                    <li>Verify basic connectivity, domain integration, and file share visibility before proceeding.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Phase 2: Implementation</h3>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Deploy Debian to all machines, integrate them with AD, and configure them for centralized home directories and OneDrive access.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Steps Include:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use PXE booting and the prepared Debian image to install the OS on all 20 machines.</li>
                    <li>Leverage Ansible to install and configure Samba, Winbind, Rclone, and related packages.</li>
                    <li>Join each machine to the AD domain and confirm domain user lookup works consistently.</li>
                    <li>Set up PAM configurations so that home directories are created and mounted on login.</li>
                    <li>Integrate Rclone-based OneDrive access, ensuring users can access their cloud files easily.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Phase 3: Testing</h3>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Validate the environment by having test users log in, test file access, and confirm that everything performs as expected.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Steps Include:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Have a subset of pupils or test accounts log in to multiple machines using their AD credentials.</li>
                    <li>Verify that home directories follow each user regardless of which machine they use.</li>
                    <li>Check OneDrive file access through Rclone mounts, ensuring stable file loading.</li>
                    <li>Monitor performance with both large and small file transfers.</li>
                    <li>Gather feedback from users on usability, performance, and reliability.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Phase 4: Evaluation</h3>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Analyse the results of the pilot and determine whether to scale the solution further.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Steps Include:</strong></p>
